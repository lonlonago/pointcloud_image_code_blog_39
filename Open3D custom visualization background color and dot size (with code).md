#  Function overview 

   There are < cloud_viewer > for simple visualization operations and < pcl_visualizer > for advanced visualization in PCL, and there are also draw_geometries () and Visualizer () for visualization of point clouds in open3d. Personal understanding draw_geometries () in open3d is similar to < cloud_viewer > in PCL, but it is richer than < cloud_viewer > in PCL; Visualizer () in open3d is similar to < pcl_visualizer in PCL and cv :: s h ow () in opencv, which can realize all the functions in visualization operations.
