#  I. Overview of algorithms 

   There is a point cloud and I want to find its maximum and minimum values on the three axes x, y, and z. 

##  1. Main function 

   The min () and amin () functions in numpy can be used to obtain the minimum value. 

  ```python

  ```  
   When the input is not necessarily numpy.array, use np.amin (), if the input is np.array, you can directly use input.min (axis = n) to find the minimum value. Only the usage of np.min () and np.amin () is different. The result is the same.

  ```  
   The max () and amax () functions in numpy can be used to obtain the maximum value. The usage is the same as min () and amin ().
